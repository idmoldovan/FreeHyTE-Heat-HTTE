% INPUT DATA (read from the *.mat files created by the GUIs):
% * from HeatStructDef: k thermal conductivity coefficient  and Q internal 
% generated heat, NumberGaussPoints (the nuber of Gauss-Legendre points for the side
% integration), EdgesOrder and LoopsOrder (the orders of the approximation
% bases on the essential edges of the mesh and in the finite elements);
% * from HeatTriBC1: nodes, edges_nodes, edges_loops, loops_nodes and 
% loops_edges. These variables contain geometrical and topological 
% information regarding the mesh. For a full description of these
% variables, please consult Section 5.3 of reference [2];
% * from HeatTriBC2: edgesDirichlet, edgesNeumann, dataTemp, dataHeat;
% * edgesDirichlet (edgesNeumann): list with the Dirichlet (Neumann) edges;
% * dataTemp (dataHeat): cell array with three columns and as many lines as
% Dirichlet (Neumann) edges. For each edge, it stores the edge's index, 
% and the Dirichlet (Neumann) boundary conditions in the normal and 
% tangential directions. The boundary conditions are stored as strings. For
% further details regarding the definition of the boundary conditions,
% please refer to Section 4.6 of reference [3].
%
%
% OUTPUT DATA to function MAINTRI:
% * NGP is the number of Gauss points for the line integration;
% * Nodes is a (NNODE x 2) matrix, where NNODE is the number of nodes in 
% mesh. It stores the coordinates of each node;
% * Edges, Loops and BConds are data structures storing information
% on the edges, finite elements (loops) and boundary conditions,
% respectively. They are documented in Section 5.3 of reference [2];
% * NoDiv^2 is the number of points for plotting the colormaps of the
% solution.

%% MATERIAL DATA
% Loads the material data and stores them in the Loop structure. The
% material data is assumed uniform for all elements. However, users may
% overwrite the data loaded from the GUI to define elements with distinct
% material properties. An example is given below.

% GUI. It is recalled that all edges were predefined as Dirichlet.

% types.

%% TEMPERATURE AND FLUX DATA
% Boundary conditions can be described by polynomials of any order. The 
% definition of a boundary condition is made by specifying its values in 
% as many equally spaced points along the boundary as needed to define its
% polynomial variation. For further details regarding the definition of the 
% boundary conditions, please refer to Section 4.6 of reference [3].
%
% BConds data structure collects information regarding the boundary 
% conditions. Its members are cell arrays with as many lines as the 
% external boundaries of the structure. The values of the fluxes (or
% temperatures) enforced on the boundaries are stored in the Neumann (or
% Dirichlet) fields of the structure. NaN is stored in the Dirichlet field
% of a Neumann boundary, and vice-versa.

% Dirichlet field of the structure, in the normal and tangential
% directions. Users may overwrite the data loaded from the GUI to change 
% the boundary conditions.
