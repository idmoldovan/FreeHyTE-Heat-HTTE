# FreeHyTE-Heat-HTTE
FreeHyTE - Heat HTTE uses the temperature model of the hybrid-Trefftz finite element formulation for the solution of 2D steady-state heat conduction problems with interior heat generation. It can be used, in a more general context, for the solution of 2D Poisson boundary value problems with piecewise constant source terms. 

The model approximates independently the temperature field in the domain of each element and the heat flux field on its essential boundaries. The trademark of the Trefftz elements is that the domain aprroximation is constructed on functions satisfying exactly all domain equations governing the problem. The heat and temperature continuity boundary conditions are enforced weakly. Due to the relevant physical information embedded in the domain bases, Trefftz elements are insensitive gross mesh distortions and recover well high field gradients. Moreover, as compared to the conventional formulations, the temperature and heat flux solutions are much more balanced in terms of quality and very large finite elements are affordable.

The implementation features an easy-to-use GUI, regular and irregular mesh generators, saving and loading of models, adaptive solvers with pre-conditioners, and outputs, besides plots of temperature and heat flux fields, a data file with the results for posterior post-processing (if requested by the user).
